I'm a biomedical engineer with experience using medical imaging to characterize bone and muscle health among astronauts and older adults. 

I am aiming to transition into a career in biotech or health tech. I'm excited about leveraging our abundance of digital health & wellness data to help individuals enjoy longer and healthier lives.

Beyond my work, I am also a trained science communicator. I aim to make science accessible for the broader public and encourage the next generation of students to pursue careers in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine). 

I enjoy inline skating, biking, hiking new trails, reading in my hammock, caring for my overflowing family of plants, and pretty much anything else that involves being outside!
