I'm a biomedical engineer currently working as a regulatory scientist in the medical device industry. I'm most excited about digital health & wellness technologies that help individuals enjoy longer and healthier lives. Previously as a graduate researcher, I specialized in using medical imaging to characterize bone and muscle health among astronauts and older adults. 

Beyond my work, I am also a trained science communicator. I'm passionate about making science accessible for the broader public and inspiring the next generation of students to pursue STEM careers. 

I enjoy inline skating, biking, hiking new trails, reading in my hammock, caring for my overflowing family of plants, and pretty much anything else that involves being outside!
